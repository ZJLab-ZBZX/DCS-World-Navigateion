It is a demo task using DCS world. We train a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent to navigate to a randomly chosen destination in each run. 


##  Usage
1. Install requirements.txt.
2. Copy Scripts/Export.lua to C:\Users\<name>\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts. Infer your own UDP address and replace the one in Export.lua with it, i.e., host = "239.255.50.10".
3. Copy Missions/navi.miz to C:\Users\<name>\Saved Games\DCS\Missions.
4. Copy BriefingDialog.lua and GameMenu.lua to D:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World\Scripts\UI. It will replace the files with the same names.
5. Open the DCS-world game and start the navigation task.  i.e., *mission --> navi*.
6. Run the learning script with
    ```
    $ python train_dcs_gym.py
    ```
